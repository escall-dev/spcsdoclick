# Recommended PHP Application Structure (MVC)

For a system like the Electronic L&D Passbook (ELDP), the best professional standard is the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern. This structure improves security, organization, and scalability.

## 🌟 The Ideal Directory Layout

```text
/eldp-system
│
├── /public            <-- WEB ROOT (Only this folder is accessible to the world)
│   ├── index.php      <-- The "Front Controller" (Single Entry Point)
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── uploads/       <-- User uploaded files
│
├── /app               <-- Your Application Logic (Hidden from web)
│   ├── /Config        <-- Database connections
│   ├── /Controllers   <-- Handles logic (e.g., AdminController.php, AuthController.php)
│   ├── /Models        <-- Database interaction (User.php, Activity.php)
│   ├── /Views         <-- HTML Templates (The design)
│   └── /Core          <-- Router, Database helper, Validator
│
├── /logs              <-- Error logs (Private)
└── composer.json      <-- Dependency management (Standard PHP practice)
```

## 🏗️ Why This Is better

### 1. Security (The "Public" Folder)
**Current Issue:** your `admin/dashboard.php` and `includes/db.php` are all inside the main folder. If configured poorly, a hacker might access sensitive files directly.
**The Fix (`/public`):** In the recommended structure, the web server (Apache/Nginx) is pointed to the `/public` folder.
*   The Internet can **ONLY** see `index.php`, CSS, and Images.
*   The Internet **CANNOT** see your logic, database passwords, or core files because they are sitting *outside* the public folder.

### 2. The "Front Controller" (Single Entry Point)
**Current Issue:** You have `login.php`, `register.php`, `admin/dashboard.php`. Each file acts as its own gatekeeper. You have to repeat `session_start()` and permission checks in every single file.
**The Fix (`public/index.php`):** *Every* request goes through `index.php` first.
*   URL: `yoursite.com/admin/dashboard` -> sends to `index.php`.
*   `index.php` starts the session, checks if you are banned, and *then* loads the Admin Controller.
*   **Result:** You write security logic **ONCE**, and it protects the entire app.

### 3. Separation of Concerns (MVC)
**Current Issue:** In `profile.php`, you have SQL queries, PHP form handling, AND HTML code all mixed together.
**The Fix:**
*   **Model (`app/Models/User.php`)**: "I fetch user data from the database."
*   **Controller (`app/Controllers/ProfileController.php`)**: "I handle the uploaded file, validate it, and tell the Model to save it."
*   **View (`app/Views/profile.php`)**: "I only contain HTML and variables. I don't know about databases."

### 4. Grouping by Function, Not Role
**Current Issue:** You have folders named `admin/`, `hr/`, `user/`.
*   What happens if a user is both an Admin and HR? You duplicate code.
*   What happens if you change the navbar? You have to edit it in 3 places.
**The Fix:** Organize by **function**.
*   `AuthController` handles login for everyone.
*   `ActivityController` handles viewing activities for everyone (restrictions are handled in logic, not by folder location).

## 🚀 How to Transition (Eventually)

You do **not** need to rewrite everything today. But if you were to start Version 2.0:

1.  **Move Assets**: Put all CSS, JS, and Images in `public/`.
2.  **Centralize Logic**: Stop writing SQL in page files. You already started this with your "Repositories" (which act like **Models**) - this is great!
3.  **Adopt a Router**: Instead of linking to `dashboard.php`, you link to `/dashboard` and have a small script load the correct file.

### Professional Verdict
Your current structure is a "Flat PHP" structure. It is standard for beginners and small internal tools.
The recommended structure is "Modern MVC" (used by Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter). It is standard for **Professional Enterprise Applications**.

What the public folder does is that it is the only folder that is accessible to the outside world. The other folders are not accessible to the outside world. This is a security measure to prevent hackers from accessing your sensitive files. http://localhost/eldp/public/index.php
